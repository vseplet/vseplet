# Hello! 👋 My name is 🔥 Vsevolod 🔥

I have been working as a programmer for more than four years and have been studying programming for even longer. Over this time, I have gained extensive experience in organizing and optimizing workflows and developing projects from scratch — from SPA applications to embedded systems.

## 🚀 What I do:

- Organizing and optimizing workflows, selecting technical solutions, and system design.
- Developing tools to simplify developers' lives, such as:
  - **[DevExp CLI](https://github.com/devexp-pro/cli):** Powerful CLI tool to improve developer experience.
  - **[Reface](https://github.com/devexp-pro/reface):** An embeddable fullstack framework for creating Hypermedia-Driven Applications without a build step, based on HTMX and Hono.
  - **[Shibui](https://github.com/vseplet/shibui):** A universal automation script management framework.
  - **[Fetchify](https://github.com/vseplet/fetchify):** A gentle, promise-based HTTP client.
  - **[Apifly](https://github.com/vseplet/apifly):** A cross-runtime state sharing library over HTTP.
  - **[Shelly](https://github.com/vseplet/shelly):** A tool for interacting with command-line utilities using Deno.
  - **[Luminous](https://github.com/vseplet/luminous):** An extremely configurable logger for Deno and Node.js.
