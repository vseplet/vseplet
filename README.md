# Hello! 👋 My name is Vsevolod

I have been working as a programmer for more than six years and have been studying programming for even longer. Over this time, I have gained extensive experience in organizing and optimizing workflows and developing projects from scratch — from SPA applications to embedded systems.

## 🚀 What I do:

- Organizing and optimizing workflows, selecting technical solutions, and system design.

- **[IT NIGLIZM](https://itng.blog/)** My own tech blog.
- Developing tools to simplify developers' lives, such as:
  - **[DevExp CLI](https://github.com/devexp-pro/cli):** Powerful CLI tool to improve developer experience.
- Modules:
  - **[Reface](https://github.com/devexp-pro/reface):** An embeddable fullstack framework for creating Hypermedia-Driven Applications without a build step, based on HTMX and Hono.
  - **[Shibui](https://github.com/vseplet/shibui):** A universal automation script management framework.
  - **[Fetchify](https://github.com/vseplet/fetchify):** A gentle, promise-based HTTP client.

  - **[Luminous](https://github.com/vseplet/luminous):** An extremely configurable logger for Deno and Node.js.
- Experiments:
  - **[PPORT](https://pport.top):** Text-based Messenger for the Command Line
